## Introduction

This is the assignment5 of STAT545, which would mainly focus on the skills of factor, I/O and visual design. The file is well organised by four parts:  

-  Factor Management
-  File Import/Export
-  Visualization Design
-  Writing Figures to File

Let's start it with loading the packages.
```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
```

## Part 1: Factor management

- **Drop factor / levels**

To figure out the function of `droplevels`, Oceania is dropped here.

```{r}
before_drop <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent != "Oceania") 
levels(before_drop$continent)

after_drop <- droplevels(before_drop) 
levels(after_drop$continent)
```

From the above, we could see that `droplevels()` function removes unused factor Ocenia in continent.

- **Reorder levels based on knowledge from data**

In this section, the effects of `arrange()` and `fct_reorder()` are dicusssed in three dimensions: table, levels and figure.

1. Firstly, let's look into the continent of original dataset. 

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(gapminder)) # report the first factor in the table

levels(gapminder$continent) # report the order of factors

gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = continent)) +
  geom_bar() # demonstrate the sequence of levels in the plot
```

2. Then try to `arrange()` the continent in descending order. See what would happen.

```{r}

df <- gapminder %>% 
  arrange(desc(continent))

knitr::kable(head(df))

levels(df$continent)

df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = continent)) +
  geom_bar()

```

As observed, the first factor listed in the table has changed to Oceania since `arrange()`. However, it doesn't have a effect on the levels and graph.

3. Move to `fct_reorder` now. Order the continent level by the max of life expectancy.

```{r}
df <- gapminder %>% 
  mutate(continent = fct_reorder(continent,.fun=max,lifeExp))

knitr::kable(head(df))

levels(df$continent)

df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = continent)) +
  geom_bar()


```

`fct_reorder` has no effect on the contents of table. But the order of levels indeed changes. And the sequence in the graph always follows the levels. 

4. Last, use both `fct_order` and `arrange` here.

```{r}
df <- gapminder %>% 
  arrange(desc(continent)) %>% 
  mutate(continent = fct_reorder(continent, .fun=max, lifeExp))

knitr::kable(head(df))

levels(df$continent)

df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = continent)) +
  geom_bar()

```

It can be concluded that the effects of two functions mix together. The table follows `arrange` and the levels follow `fct_reorder`.

## Part 2: File I/O

Out of convenience, use `df`(non-alphabetical) from the previous section to test.

```{r}
write_csv(df,"my_df.csv")
read_df <- read_csv("my_df.csv")
summary(read_df)
head(read_df)
levels(read_df)
```

The new df from csv file stores the contents of original table, but it lose the factors.

## Part 3: Visualization design

This graph shows how the mean of life expectancy changes in five continents. 

```{r}
p <- gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent,year) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(lifeExp)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = mean,x = year)) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent) +
  geom_line() 
p
```

It's correct but not good. Let's make it more juicy now.

```{r}
p_new <- p +
  geom_point(aes(color = continent)) + # colored by continent
  labs(x = "Year",
          y = "Mean of Life Expectancy",
          title = "The mean of life expectancy over time in five continents") + # change the axis-label's names and add the title
  theme_bw() + # apply the theme
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size=7), # adjust the size of axis-text
          strip.background = element_rect(fill= "orange") # fill the background of banner
        )
p_new
```

All the changes are mentioned in the in-line code comments. The new graph is much better to diffentiate the five continents and understand what the values represent.

Next up, convert this graph to a `plotly` one.(Shown in the ![html]() file)

```{r}
ggplotly(p_new)
```

Many advantages that plotly has over ggplot2, such as:

- Interactive with graph.
- Customizing the layout (plot borders, y axis) is easier.
- Flexible for Python, Matlab, and Excel, among other languages.
- Possible for multi-dimensions graph.

## Part 4: Writing figures to file

Save the plot from the previous section to file.

```{r}
ggsave("my_plot.png", p_new, width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)
```

Then read it out.


![Load the plot](my_plot.png)
